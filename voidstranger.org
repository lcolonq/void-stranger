* General notes
- Chests must be opened from the front.
- Chests turn you around after opening them
- Shiny squares/crystals are picked up with the staff
- Staff can pick up anything, including stairs
- Obtained crystals seem to disappear in subsequent runs!
- Crystals seem to be a currency used in the "memories" menu
- A common technique is what I'm calling "boating": if you have 3 contiguous tiles, you can travel any distance.
  (Along that axis)
* Technology
- Jumping down a pit in front of a crab statue consumes all locusts and advances that many floors.
- Going down stairs in front of a 4-eyed statue (dark idol) sends you back to B001 and undoes voiding.
- "Giving up" after dying resets the game and all NPCs.
  Brands can be entered on the title screen to start with items / infinite locusts.
- Bonking the back of a chest 3 times and then waiting 3 seconds makes the chest contain 3 locusts.
- In certain levels, you can reach and manipulate the UI as tiles. I'm sure this is useful for something.
- Can hold E to skip dreams.
* Things to do/look out for
** Try "A suspicious empty chest surrounded by nothing, inspect it one too many times..."
** Investigate [[*B223]] using UI change warp or crab statue skip
** Investigate putting brands on [[*B227]].
** Try hitting the locust counts by the listed floors under [[*B089]] to summon the merchant (Mon).
Got merchant tips on: [[*B004]], [[*B044]], [[*B086]]
Need to try [[*B184]] and [[*B196]]
** Solve snake puzzle (Eus brand)

Upon entering with 3 locusts, an NPC was there and the music was different:
#+begin_quote
Ksi shi shi shi shi shi shi...
Stranger, stranger...
Are those locusts in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
How about a trade?
As you might've noticed, traveling through these halls can get rather tiresome.
There are, however, shortcuts that few know about...
If you hand over all your locusts, I'll give you a hint on how to find one of them!
We wouldn't want that noggin of yours to go completely dull.
So, how about it, stranger?

[You decided to trade your locusts for a tip]
Ksi shi shi shi shi shi shi...
Thank you.
Here's your tip, so listen carefully:
In the seventh room, just one more step beyond the exit...
Try to keep this to yourself.
It'll be more fun that way.
Now now, I never said finding those shorcuts [sic] would be easy...
It wouldn't be any fun like that anyway.

This room is the same pattern as the B001 mural, except from the stairs.
Patterns around the side glow only when the stairs are removed.
Presumably we need to replace another block with the stairs.
Doing this seemingly didn't work?

Another try - let's try just picking up the stairs and jumping down.
This warped us to another place! (labeled B???)
And we acquired "a strange feeling" in a chest.
"Your mind feels heavier"
"...You don't know what to make of it"
It looks like a cube in the UI.

Examining the empty chest:
#+begin_quote
It's empty
... Wait
There's a note inside
It's written in a language you can read
It reads:
My memory of you.
With this, you should be able to hear the voice of fallen, all who were and those who are yet to be.
And if someone else (that includes you, sis) is reading this...
Scram. -Bee
The message makes little sense to you.
#+end_quote
So I guess this does what Tail was talking about, and lets us talk to eggs? (boulders)

Talking to a boulder in that room, it says to knock the chest 6 times in a row and then wait 6 seconds for the exit to appear.
#+begin_quote
Knock that chest over there six times in a row...
Remain still and wait for six seconds...
The exit will reveal itself...

Sheesh.
Scared me senseless right there you know.

[The frightened lady seems to have regained her composure]
[You ask her what she's doing here]
I was about to ask you the same thing.
Honestly I can't even remember how I ended up in this place.
What was I doing?
Sister Ballbuster is gonna skin me alive if I don't show up soon.
It's a pinch.

You wouldn't happen to know a way out?
[You tell her the only option is to keep moving]
And here I thought you looked so capable.
Seriously, don't leave me hanging like that.
Especially with these things crawling around.
You've seen them too, haven't you?
Or am I going crazy?

...
Wait.
I think I remember now.
I was working in the garden when I stumbled upon this strange pit.
I'm sure it wasn't there before, its edges were too clean.
Almost like it had appeared out of nowhere.
I must have fallen and hit my head or something like that.
Is this a dream?

[She seems to be lost in thought]

[She seems to be lost in thought]

...
Hey.
Do you believe in ***?
Sister Ballbuster never stops yapping about that stuff.
You must repent, only then *** will save you.
Despite how I may look, I never believed it.
Sure I've made a few mistakes in my life...
But it seems awfully convenient, don't you think?
Just believe in *** and in the end everything will be alright.
Like someone came up with it to have an easy way out.
...
What am I even talking about anymore.
Forget it.
I need to prepare my sorry ass for a whooping.
Oh, and if you happen to find the exit, let me know, thanks.

Many boulders, funny statue (looks like up arrow)
Huge snake woman.
Her name is Tail.
Apparently the "boulders" are eggs, and you can hear their thoughts?
Some floors have more than one exit, but they are hidden, and only the remaining Void Lords know how to access them.
She has a story:
#+begin_quote
When Void was still in flux, when all eight Void Lords still roamed these parts...
One of them, named Eus, ruled over this particular realm.
They were assigned as the gatekeeper and the judge of the lost souls who arrived here.
No soul could get past their judgment, no sin went unpunished.
But as vigilant and rigorous as they were, Eus was endlessly fascinated by sin.
This fascination grew and grew, until Eus did the unthinkable and committed sin themself.
What was the true extent of their sin, I'm not entirely sure.
When the other lords learned of this transgression, their ranks divided.
Some of them defended Eus, some reviled them.
Soon arguments turned into fights and those fights turned into vicious battles.
In the end, Eus was devoured so that nothing remained.
Well, one part of Eus did manage to slither away unnoticed.
It lay in silence, mindlessly consuming any stray souls that approached it.
It only knew pain and hunger.
But as its wounds began to heal, it learned to think.
It started to ponder why no amount of lost souls would satiate it.
Why it was unable to leave these walls.
Why it was allowed to live.
Eventually it accepted its rotten existence, knowing well that none of its questions would ever be answered.
That's how I came to be.

Hello, little one.

It talks...?!

Sorry, did I startle you there?
... I should've known better, considering your kind tends to keep their distance from me.
But I assure you I mean no harm.
In truth, I haven't spoken with anyone in ages, so this is quite refreshing.
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Tail.

You seem surprisingly calm for someone of your size.

Well, it's not like I speak with giant snakes on an everyday basis.
Actually, I think I may've heard stories about you when I was much younger.
My memories are quite hazy...
But you don't look like I imagined.

Is that so?
... That makes sense.

Have you heard of the Void Lords as well, little one?
Are you talking about the demons?
Yeah, I think that's what my...
...
... She used to call them.

A long time ago, I was a part of one of the Lords.
While all Lords are able to change their appearance as they wish...
My Lord, Eus, was unique.
They say everyone saw them differently, that their form would reflect the viewer's one true love.
What purpose that trait served I can't tell.
But it seems I might have inherited it.
Considering you can see my true form...
I guess you haven't met anyone you'd like to copulate with?

... What's up with the crass tongue all of a sudden?
Love isn't about...
... Copulating...
Besides, the last few years have just been a bit rocky, okay?

Sorry.
My understanding of mortals and their manners is rather limited.

... Why am I talking about this with you in the first place?
Why am I in here anyway?
Isn't this just a bad dream?
From your point of view, that might as well be true.
Don't let your guard down however.
Those without strong devotion are bound to lose their way within this labyrinth, until nothing remains of them.
Whatever it is that you're looking for...
I hope you find it eventually.

... Thanks, I guess.

Take care, little one.

Indeed.

Two, three hundred years?
I hope I haven't angered you...

Calm down.
I'm not after you.
Speaking of...
Have you seen Bee around here?

Hmm, they did come here and tell me not to speak with strangers.
But that was a good while ago.
Have they gone missing?

Don't worry about it.
I'll find them eventually.

Maybe Gor knows something?

I doubt it.
They're probably sleeping, as usual.

Hmmm...

Was there anything else?

I'm not sure if this is of any help to you, but...
Someone else did pass by earlier.

What about it?

It was Mon.

Mon?
Are you certain?

I didn't see them properly.
They were groping my scales.
I don't usually mind that much.
Yet something about their touch made me feel uncomfortable.
Like I had felt something similar before.
It's certainly Mon.

...
Did they talk to you?

No, but they were muttering something.
About heading towards The Seventh Circle.

Lev's territory...

You sound concerned.

Mon should be dead.
Lev themself killed them back then...
Or so I thought.
Something doesn't add up.
...
Worrying does us little good.
Just stay vigilant for now.

I'll do my best...
Good luck with your search, Cif.

Don't even get me started on those smaller things!
And my dress...
It's ruined!

[You remark that her extravagant dress will only get in the way]
There's no way I'm leaving it behind!
Do you have any idea how much this cost?
... Judging by your rags, you most certainly do not.
Seriously, what ARE you wearing?
Urgh, this is a nightmare...

Look, if you can't show me a way out of this ditch...
Do me a favour and leave me alone, you eyesore.

#+begin_quote
Are we there yet?
Don't try to fool me.
I know you aren't really sleeping.
Maybe I could actually get some rest if you weren't so impatient, Your Highness.
Come on, it's freezing here!
What kind of a nut job lives in a country like this?
This country isn't that different from yours, Your Highness.
In fact, a few years ago it was in an even more worrisome state.
An especially harsh and long winter had taken a toll on people's harvest.
Famine and disease spread among both poor and rich.
Not even the country's king was spared.
After the ruler passed away without an heir, the weakened country was nearly swallowed by it's warring neighbours.
But then, a previously unknown knight rose to the occassion.
He swiftly quelled the rising inner tensions...
And despite being heavily outnumbered, his army easily warded off other nations aiming to seize the throne.
Peace returned, and the knight declared sovereignty of his own.
The country has begun to prosper once again.
It's no wonder His Majesty seeks to ally himself with the leader of this land...
... The one they call Knight of the Heavens.
Please, I've heard this sales pitch before.
Why don't you marry him since you're such a big fan.
And that pompous nickname... I think I'm going to puke.
Well, it certainly isn't in the same league with yours, Your Highness.
Shut it.
<crash>
Your Highness, are you okay?!
Y-yeah...
More or less.
What the hell was that?!
An avalanche, perhaps...
...
Please stay inside, Your Highness.
Lady Gray!
An avalanche has blocked our way!
We've been separated from the rest of the convoy!
Why is the rearguard taking so long?!
You don't have to worry about them.
They've already been taken care of.
Didn't put up much of a fight though.
But to make things easier for you...
Just hand over the crown head!
(How does a lowly group of bandits know about the princess...?)
And if I were to refuse?
You haven't got much of a choice in the matter, lass.
Don't think that pretty face of yours will save you.
... Or maybe this courtlady knows how to handle a sword.
That's a laugh and a bunch!
It seems even scum like you know that no courtlady would ever carry a weapon.
However, you're seriously mistaken if you think I'm out of options.
Oh really now?
And what might these options be?
I could let you live.
... What the-

Get back inside, Your Highness!
And miss the finishing blow?
No way!
Well well well.
My luck has finally turned...
Get her, lads!
Heh.
Looks like this sorry crook got seriously one-upped.
I was starting to worry why my guests didn't show up.
My apologies.
Filth such as them have yet to be completely wiped from this country.

The next time, the tree is withered.
*** Lillie
#+begin_quote
In the beginning, when sky and earth were still one and the same...
A flower bloomed, lighting up the space with stars.
Beings who basked in their light were granted both thought and emotion.
Among those beings were humans.
Filled with gratitude, people began to pray to the stars.
But the stars didn't answer them.
Maybe they can't hear us from this far, people thought.
With their combined efforts, the worshipers built a great tower.
Atop of it humans were able to grow wings and fly as far as the eye can see.
These winged messengers took flight, hoping to one day reach the stars they so admired...
Time passed, until one day, something unexpected happened.
A star has fallen don, people rejoiced with excitement as they gathered around it from far and wide.
Had the stars finally heard their prayers?
This must be an answer!
But the fallen star didn't shine like the others.
It's light was a completely black and cold void.
From that light arose beings of unspeakable horror.
Beings that preyed upon the weak minded, offering them power and eternal life...
For them, humans were nothing but playthings, a fertile ground to sow their seeds of disorder and deceit.
When people saw the true nature of these demons, they sealed the fallen star within the tower and buried it so deep no one would ever see its light again.
But it was all too late.
For demons had already found their way into man's heart.
And so, just like people had once learned to admire the stars...
They also learned to fear them.

... Mom?
Yes dear?
Could you read me a different story before bedtime for once?
I've heard this one so many times already!

Most have already forgotten this story completely.
It's very important that you remember it.

But why?
Demons aren't real...
Right?

...
Of course not.
And even if they were real...
I would protect you from them.
So you've got nothing to fear.

... I'd still like to hear Sleeping Beauty instead...

... How about I read it to you next time?

Promise?

Promise.
Now, time to say good night.

Good night, mom.

Taking down those goons in one fell swoop...

And then he gave that bandit that look just before frying his sorry ass...

Please, try to calm down a bit, Your Highness.
This has been a long day for you.
I'm know, but I'm too excited to sleep...
Hey, do you think I'll be able to meet Johann tomorrow?
Maybe he'll show me how to do that lightning spell!
Such magic shouldn't be used lightly, Your Highness.
Killjoy Gray strikes again...
Are you perhaps a bit envious?
Enjoying the snowfall?
Our winter has its upsides, don't you think?
Your Lordship!
Forgive me, I almost didn't recognize you without the armor.
Allow me to thank you once more for saving Her Highness, Your Lordship.
It was the least I could do.
I hope Her Highness is feeling better?
She fell asleep, finally.
She must've been exhausted after all that.
But no need to worry, Your Lordship.
She isn't the kind to get easily startled.
Although Your Lordship did leave quite an impression on her.
Please, just call me Johann.
I'm not really a man of lofty titles.
... I'd heard you were rather down-to-earth.
Although I didn't expect you to still rush into battle all by yourself.
A good ruler does anything in their power to right the wrong.
That's simply their responsibility.
Alas, not all rulers abide by such ideals.
Many horrible things have happened to this country and its people by the result of simple negligence.
I wish not to repeat that mistake.
Even if it means getting my hands dirty from time to time.
Speaking of which, things may not have turned out so well today without your contribution, Lady Gray.
As I understand, you held off those bandits for quite some time all by yourself.
I was simply doing my part as the lady-in-waiting.
And then some, I'd argue.
Do not belittle yourself.
I can tell you're not an ordinary courtlady, Lady Grey.
Or should I say "Gray the Destroyer"?
...
So you too have heard of it.
I've done by best to leave that nickname behind me, along with my past deeds.
But as long as I can serve Her Highness to the best of my abilities...
That's all that matters.
I admire your devotion towards Her Highness.
Still, I can't help but wojnder...
A fighter of your capability could've dispatched that paltry band of thieves in an instant.
Yet you took your time, almost as if you were simply toying with them.
When you were fighting those crooks...
Did you, at any moment, enjoy it?
...!
...
That's tactless of me...
Pay my frivolous musings no mind.
Starting tomorrow, I'd like to get to know this Demon Princess of yours a little better.
... With your assistance, if you're willing.
Of course.
I'm sure Her Highness would be delighted as well.
I'll be looking forward to it, then.
Have a good night, Lady Gray.

Anyway, you rascals should hurry up.
Your ride is waiting.

Oh, you aren't taking them?

Naw, I put Kalle on the job.
So how about a cup of coffee while we wait here for these two to finish off their sugar rush tour?

Of course.

And that was by far the second largest waffle I've ever had.

Sounds like such a fun place...
I wish I could visit one day...

You should totally tag along next year.
We could even bring the girls with us.

Would you be okay with that?

Sure.
They're old enough already.

... Yeah.
Time sure does fly...

...
I don't like to butt in.
But Sonia told me that Lillie got into another fight at school.
I was just wondering how you are doing.

...
You know how headstrong Lillie can be.
I'd like to believe it's just a phase.
But at times I wonder if I could've done something differently.
Of if I was meant to become a mother at all.

...
... Gray.
You're the best parent anyone could hope for.
I'm sure Lillie thinks the same way.
If only you could see it yourself.

...

I'll take it that you haven't told Lillie yet?

... No.
I'm not even sure I could.

I figured you'd rather not talk about it...
But you need to learn to let go of your past demons, whatever they might be.
Lillie isn't stupid either.
She can sense your anxiety.
Maybe that's why she's keeps acting so...
... Look, all I'm saying is you need to relax and stop being so harsh on yourself.
When's the last time you've been out?

... I really don't think a woman of my age should worry about something like that...

Nonsense.

I bet you could catch anyone with those wicked charms of yours.
Or did you think I bought those Pr***D****s just to make your back feel better?

... ... ...
... Shut up, you...

Oh, speaking of which, I should totally hook you up with this one guy I know.
He's divorced and got some children already.
Steady career and all, it's a no-brainer.

I don't know...

Come on.
Live a little.

...
Fine.
Just this once.

... Did I just convince Gray the Immovable to go on a date?
What a time to be alive.

Watch it, or I might just change my mind...

We're home!

Well, did you get any candy?

Lots!

... You know you can't eat all that at once, right?

Okay...

I almost forgot!

I'll have to take a picture of you two.

Hey, do you think I smell?

Stop smiling, you wisecrack.
It's a bit unusual to see you like this, that's all.
Is it because of Lord Johann?

... I just want to look my best when he arrives.
We don't know when he'll come to visit us though, Your Highness.
That's exactly why I need to be ready!
It could even take a few weeks.
Ugh...
Didn't you receive another letter from him just recently, Your Highness?
Yes, but I still haven't finished my reply!
Come to think of it, you've been acting somewhat strange ever since.
And what if I have?
Obviously it's neither my duty nor place to judge, Your Highness.
But don't you think you might be advancing a tad hastily?

Would you prefer if I'd broken a few ribs first?
You know what I mean, Your Highness.
You worry too much, Gray.

But we're approaching uncharted territories and I'd rather be safe than sorry.

Dear Lord Johann
I feel my heart racing restlessly as I write this letter.
And as I grasp for words, my mind follows suit not far behind.
It is all because of you.
Again and again I return to the moments we spent together.
But those simple memories will not cease this ache.
I hold you responsible.
Therefore I've decided not to share my answer until I can see you again.

We just brought it back to the current century.

Enough talk!
Let's have a look.

What's your verdict, your highness?

Go get them!

When did you learn such langujage?

D A T E S T A R T!

... Am I at the right table?

Well...
Even if it was the wrong one, I certainly wouldn't mind.
... ... ...

(Wanna get your ass handed to you or what?!)

Sorry, couldn't resist.
One-liners like that aren't really my thing.
You must be Gray, right?
Pleased to finally meet you.

Likewise, Daniel...
Just Dan will do.
Would you like to have anything to drink?

J-just water, thank you.

You sure?

(Am I that nervous...?)
It's fine, really!

...

...
(Crap, this got awkward quick...)
(What did Freya say again...?)

What to talk about during the first date?
Don't worry about it!
Dan is a really laid-back guy.
Just be yourself and I'm sure you two will hit it off in no time!

(... Thanks for nothing.)
(Quick, think of something to say!)

<Choice between [Talk about weather] and [Talk about Dan's work], chose weather.>

Actually, maybe I should have tea instead.
It's gtting pretty cold out there after all.
I really don't mind the snow but I'd rather not...
... Freeze to...
Death.

...
You're really grasping at straws there.

...!
Freya said you don't go out too much.
But although she's told me quite a lot about you...
You're nothing like I imagined.

Quite a lot?!
(Freya, your ass is grass.)

... I feel like I'm wasting your time...

Not at all.
The night is still young.
Why don't you tell me something about yourself?
I heard you work at the university.
I'd love to hear more about it.

I doubt you'd find it very interesting...

You're talking to an accountant-for-hire.
Try me.

At least I warned you...
I work at the linguistics department that specializes in dead and extinct languages.

Oh, so you're a teacher?

Nothing like that I'm afraid.
More of an assistant.
Most of the time I help with preservation and translation of old manuscripts.

Sound pretty highbrow to me.

Well, it pays the bills.
(Barely.)

How does one end up studying something like that?

I-I just read a lot when I was younger, that's all.
(That's a fat lie.)
It's the only thing I'm any good at now.
Still...
Reading those old texts and seeing how far we've come has made me realize...
The people of this world have already forgotten so much, you can't imagine.
Entire nations have disappeared without a trace...
Along with the countless dreams and memories of those who lived.
I'm just trying to understand it all, so we don't repeat whatever mistakes they made.

...

I'm sorry!
I went way overboard there.

No no, don't be. 
I was just taken aback.
It's strange, but for a moment I thought I saw something different about you...

...?

Never mind.
Just running my mouth.

Would you mind me asking something?

Go for it.

<Choice between asking about his children and the future. Chose future>

What do you want from the future?

Hmmm...
Things have settled down quite a bit during the last couple of years.
But looking back now I think I might've been too focused on my work.
I'm looking for more excitement in my life.
Like traveling the world and meeting new people...
Hopefully I'll be able to meet someone who wants to join the ride before I get too old.
Have you traveled by any chance?

Not that I remember...

Hmm?

Err, I mean, not really.
But lately I've had thoughts of going somewhere far away.

Anything particular in mind?

No, I...
I think it's something more akin to leaving everything behind.
I honestly feel guilty about it.
This must sound pretty silly, right?

If I had to bet, I'd guess we've all had thoughts like that at some point.
Nothing wrong with that if you ask me.

You don't think I'm a terrible parent for saying something like that out loud?

You're still here, aren't you?
Besides, I've had it easy compared to you.

... So Freya told you about that as well.

...
Sorry, I let it slip.
Freya did mention your daughter, but...
I'll take it her father isn't around much?

... ... ...

... That bad, huh.
Sorry, I really shouldn't have brought it up.

No.
I should be the one apologizing.
My daughter...
Lillie.
I haven't told her anything about her father.
Even if it's not the right thing to do...
I swore to take care of her.
No matter what.

You really do love your daughter, don't you?

The trick is to grab the (nearer) ice protruding near the starting point, and use it to bridge the other side.
Also, grab a block by doubling back where it's safe in the middle to re-build that bridge.
Be really careful, it's not too complex but any wrong move is a reset.

Seems like you figured it out.
You're stuck.
There's no way around this.
This is impossible.
... Is what I'd like to say.
Like that would be enough to stop you.
Trust me, I should know.

You probably prepared yourself for this already...
Things won't get any easier from here.
Honestly, I can't even tell how much you've got left...
But you can't give up.
You won't give up.
Because someone is waiting for you.
You don't need me to tell you that.
Just...
Just don't be too hard on yourself.
Even when answers escape you and you're ready to succumb into despair...
I believe in you.

Took your sweet time to get this far.
Getting tired already?
Or do you still wishfully think this is all just a dream?
Here's a spoiler.
You aren't waking up anytime soon.
When will you accept that?
Then again...
You were always good at convincing yourself otherwise.

What are you doing here anyway?
Give up already.
There's no point in delaying the inevitable.

Is this place big enough?
Seems sort of cramped.
I'm sure this will suffice for our purposes, Your Highness.
Unless you'd prefer the main ballroom instead?
No way!
I don't want Johann barging in while we, you know...
If only you'd been so keen when you were younger, we wouldn't be in such a hurry.
Well, it's now or never!
So stop yapping and get on with it!
Of course, Your Highness.
And you'd better keep your promise!
Yes yes.
No wisecracking whatsoever.
Good.
May I have this dance, Your Highness?
Just do me in already...
And place your left hand on my shoulder, like so...
Now, just follow my lead and try to relax.
Okay...
You'll be fine, Your Highness.
Let us begin!
#+end_quote

Rhythm game! Dancing

#+begin_quote
Hey Gray?
Yes, Your Highness?
It's almost strange, to see you dancing.
How so?
I'm more used to seeing you kick and punch stuff.
Where did you learn to dance like that?
Or can't you remember that either?
Oh, I do remember that quite well.
I was about your age.
ALl I knew back then was...
Kicking and punching stuff, as you'd say.
So I was rather apprehensive at first.
Luckily I had a good teacher.
Hmmm?
Her Majesty, of course.
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
That was very tactless of me.
Don't worry, Gray.
I can't remember a thing about mother anyway.
And yet...
At times like these I wish she'd still be around.
...
I'm sure she is watching among the blessed stars, Your Highness.
Especially now that your big day is only a few weeks away.
... You really think so?
You resemble her more and more by each passing year.
You'd make her proud.
What is it, Gray?
Oh, nothing.
I must be hearing things.
(Was someone at the door just now...?)
So, should we give it another go?
Practice makes perfect after all.
If you insist.
(I wonder if you really are watching...)

This is preposterous!

Please, no need to raise your voice like that...

You skate on way too thin an ice to share any advice right now.
We've been over this too many times already.
Yet your daughter once again finds herself in the middle of a brawl...
This time with students a year older than her!

But as I understand it, Lillie wasn't the one who instigated the fight...

That's besides the point!
She dislocated an elbow of one of the boys!
Do you have any idea what lengths I had to go to in order to calm down his parents?

I'm terribly sorry...
I'll make sure this won't happen again.

... This is your last chance.

<Gray and Lillie in car>

Got anything to say for yourself, young lady?

Why bother.
Or did you suddenly start to care about my opinion?

...
I talked with the principal.
Tomorrow you'll have to apologize to that boy for what you did.
And I want you to mean it too.

Thanks a lot.
The only thing I'm sorry for is that I didn't get his other arm as well...

Didn't I make myself perfectly clear when I trained you?
You're only supposed to defend yourself.

Those idiots started it!
They kept making fun of my hair and voice...

Because they know it gets to you.
You'll just have to...

Yeah yeah...
Laugh it off.
Such bullshit...

Language.

... Crap.

Lillie...
I'm always on your side.
What those boys said about you, what they called you...
At some point in time, I would've beaten them up myself had I been there.

... Then what changed?

I got old.
I realized punches and kicks won't fix anything.
You're only bringing yourself down to their level.
You're better than that.

... ... ...
I'm sorry...
For being such a screwup...

Don't say that, dear...

How about we grab some takeaway?

Also, TV is banned for a month.

Jumped down the hole past the boulder, ended up in another B???.

The strange statue zaps you if you are in its line of sight.
Hid behind snake to get past it.

Jumped down another hole.
Arrived in another B???.
This one has two oxen, a punishment statue, and another laser statue.
Blocked the statue with the oxen.

Jumped down another hole.
Arrived in another B???.
This one has two grubs, one mouth ghost, a punishment statue, a bunch of sigil pads, and two laser statues.
This one is precise - need to use mouth ghost to get past one statue and stop one grub from kiling itself.
Then grab shadow and use grub + shadow to get past the other statue into hole.

Jumped down another hole.
This one has a clone, a punishment statue, and the hole surrounded by 3 laser statues.
This one is pretty easy, killed all the statues with the clone.

Jumped down another hole.
2 black clones, one gray clone, punishment statue, horned statues, laser statues.
Hard one.
Have one black clone kill the other with the statue.
Use the grey and black clones to get past the statue, then kill the clones.

Jumped down another hole.
This one has a laser statue blocked by a horn statue, and a clone in a closed off area with tiles that kill it instantly.
Easy.

Jumped down another hole.
This one has many laser statues blocked by horn statues, and many mouth ghosts in an area full of death tiles.
Easy.

Jumped down another hole.
This one is also very easy.

Jumped down another hole.
This one has two boulders!
Pretty easy: use clone to move boulder and then push statue up into pit.
First boulder: "Can I pray?" (seems like generic)
Second boulder: "Nothing" (seems like generic)

Jumped down another hole.
Many pits, many snakes and grubs. Boulder and pit behind horned statues.

My apologies.

Why'd you call me here, Lady Gray.
This has to end.
What are you talking about?
You know very well what I mean.

I'll marry your little princess and make her my queen...

Isn't this what you wished for?
Lily truly loves you.
So what?
Her emotions are meaningless.
You've made it this far already.
Her Highness will never be the wiser.
After all, she's just a naive, spoiled brat...

She might be an insufferable, childish little imp...
But I once made a promise to protect her.
That's all that matters to me.
... I thought you of all people would understand the importance of our responsibilities.
I clearly misjudged you, Lady Gray.
But don't get the wrong idea.
It's too late to turn back now.
In that case I'll tell everything to Lily.qq
You wouldn't...
Surely you understand what would happen...!
So be it!
Lily doesn't deserve this!
I truly admired you...
Ever since I saw you take care of those mercenaries...
I knew you were most exceptional...
Truly a waste.
Unfortunately, my plans were set in motion long before you showed up, and I really don't have time for this...
So if I can't have what I desire...

4-eyes statue.
Rather difficult.
Involves a lot of tedious shuffling again.
Never touch a sigil, try to get below the bottom hand (after it's killed by the statue)
Push left and staff immediately.
** B218
4-eyes statue.
Easy, but a lot of tedious boating.
** B219
4-eyes statue
I think I did this the wrong way, but basically I just put the button next to the stairs.
Then I let the diamond chase me and push the button.
Didn't use the shadow at all.
** B220
4-eyes statue.
Easy.
Rearranged buttons and stairs, walked around one loop twice to get two shadows.
** B221
4-eyes statue.
Tough one, but the same general theme - put the button next to the stairs, get a shadow.
Lots of boating.
Goal is to collect all the solid floors together.

Your Highness!

By the sacred stars what do you think you're doing?!
What's wrong with you...
...
Come on...
Let's get you inside...

Halt, Gray the Destroyer!
Step away from the princess!
What...
What are all these soldiers doing in here, Johann?!
You tell me, my dear lady.
What sad state of affairs this is...
To think the princess' loyal servant would prove to be such an envious persion...
... That she would attempt to assault Her Highness right before her wedding day.
I guess it's expected from a former outlaw.
Assault...?!
How impudent can you get!
Once the king hears about this...!
I've informed His Majesty about the situation.
He entrusted me with the task of capturing you.
It goes without saying that this kind of treachery won't go unpunished.
You'll be executed tomorrow.
We wouldn't want to spoil the mood for the wedding or the coronation ceremony, now would we?
... You absolute scum of the earth...
Now now.
Don't be hasty.
My men are well aware of your reputation, Gray the Destroyer.
I don't think even you would be brazen enough to believe you could take them all head on.
I couldn't care less...
As long as your head rolls along with mine!
Stop!
Your Highness...
Please stop this, Johann...
I'll do what you want.
Just don't hurt Gray.
My...
For once, the princess is the voice of reason. What a pleasant surprise.
How about it, Gray the Destroyer?
Turn yourself in peacefully and I'll make sure to honor Her Highness' wish.

Now, off with the head!

I'm home!

Took your sweet time...
Dinner is almost ready.

W-what...
What happened to your hair?

Ehehehe...
You noticed?

Explain yourself, young lady.
Sonia said she wanted to practice...
So I volunteered!

Couldn't she ask for anyone else?!
You've been growing your hair since you were little!
It may never grow as long again!

Well tough luck.
The deed is done.

... Why didn't you say anything beforehand?

Because I knew you would just fume about it and tell me no.
I'm old enough to decide what I want to do with my own hair.

Clearly no.

What's that supposed to mean?

Haven't you hard that variety is the spice of live and all that?
Besides, short hair is all the rage now.
Boys like it too.

So you cut your hair just for some passing fad...
To impress some brainless punks?
Don't you know what they say about short-haired women?

Umm, welcome to the 21st century, granny.
Why don't you get your hair cut as well.
Who knows, maybe that way you could get some action between those uptight legs of yours and loosen up a bit.

<slap>

I won't listen to such talk from anyone in this house.
How did you turn out such a haughty woman...

And what happened to your hair?
Some kind of accident perhaps?

My hair is doing fine, thank you.
And don't you girl at me!
Is that how you're supposed to talk to ladies?
Or did you escape from a nursing home, old man?

What a shameless woman.
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

You could be the emperor of Whaddayacallit for all I care.

Rest tree.
Standard dialogue.
Rested.

Upon returning, gray is in the dungeon alongside frantic man.
#+begin_quote
Lady Gray!
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the guards taking you...!
They I heard about the assault accusation...
What poppycock!
You would never hurt Her Highness!
The ceremony has already started.
I don't know why, but something...
Something just isn't right.
That's why I took the liberty of bringing in your battle attire.
Although I hope it doesn't come down to it...
Please, Lady Gray, save Her Highness and escape!
Only you can do it...
Onl you can protect her happiness!
That's what Her Majesty would've wanted!

Take cover.
I'll distract the guards.

Oh no!
The prisoner is escaping!
She went this way!
Hurry up and catch her, you dolts!

<Gray flees>

Lady Gray!
Don't worry!
Four-eyes clued us in.
We'll do our best to hold back Lord Johann's men.
Maybe our good-for-nothing lives will finally matter, even just a little bit...
Now go!
Rescue Her Highness and flee!

It seems the lady-in-waiting has clawed her way out of the dungeon.
Gray!
Your Highness, are you okay?!
I'm sorry, Gray...
I couldn't do anything...
Now everyone has...!
What's the meaning of this, Johann?!
I'm afraid you arrived just a bit too late.
The sacrifice...
It is almost done.
What...?

Everything in this world comes with a price.
I learned this lesson a long time ago when I lay wounded on a silent battlefield, starving and freezing to death...
I kept praying to the stars but the stars wouldn't answer.
Until finally all I could do...
... Was to curse my rotten fate and blame those responsible for it.
Then they appeared before me.
They promised me life and power to change this world.
All they needed in exchange was my unwavering devotion.

Led by that, I come to offer this measly kingdom and its inhabitants as part of our contract.
Show yourselves, Lords of the Void!

Yeah yeah.
Ease on the melodrama.

...

... So these fiends are the source of your power...
Demons!

Hmm, I think that's what you mortals do call us now...
While I don't like the sound of it...
Explaining it all in detail would be way too complicated for you.
Demons will do.

The hell I care what you're called!
Just leave Her Highness out of this, Johann!

My quota is still a bit short, correct?

... That is correct.
One soul remains.

What ever shall I do...

How about you help me decide, my dear lady?
If you offer your soul as the final part of my sacrifice, I'll promise to let your princess live.

... And why would I trust you ever again?
Because you'll cling to any semblance of hope of keeping your petty princess safe.
Just like you did in order to persuade me into marrying her...

Shut up you bastard!
If only you'd known I'd marry Her Highness either way to fulfill my plan...
Luckily playing hard to catch paid off in spades, since I quite enjoyed your...
Enthusiasm.

...
So do what you do best!
Squirm before me, o mighty Gray the Destroyer!

...
I...

Don't you even think about it!

...!
The Gray I know isn't such a wuss!
Groveling like that is pathetic!
After all these years...
... You now decide it's okay to just quietly fade away?!
Quit acting like you're about to give up!

... Now I'm getting a pep talk from Her Highness...
How low I must've fallen...

<Gray puts down her hair and prepares to fight>

Johann.
I refuse your offer.
And I'll make sure you'll pay for all you've done.
I swear it as Gray the Destroyer!

...
Bee.

Umm, that's "Lord" Bee to you...

Would you like to entertain this haughty wench?

Ooooh, really?!
Can I do it, sis?

... Do as you please.
But if DIS finds out, you're on your own.

Yay!
Hello!
I'm Void Lord Bee!
Nice to meet you.
Now...
LET'S GET FIRED UP, MORTAL!

What are you?

Huh, did it break already?
Boooring.

You should be pleased she lasted for that long.
Usually mortals simply lose their minds at the sight of our true forms.
Either way...
Playtime is over.
Complete the sacrifice, surrogate.

Will that fulfill my contract?

Naturally.

Watching you struggle was truly magnificent.
Shame things turned out this way...
As the future emperor of this waking world, I would've loved to have you beside me...!

(Crap...)
(I'm sorry...)
(I couldn't fulfill my promise to you...)
(I can only pray for Lily's safety with you... In the afterlife...)

Wait!
Hey, big horns!

... Big what now...?

I don't fully understand what's going on...
But if Johann made some kind of contract with you...
... I want to make one as well!
I'll offer myself!
All I want is that you leave Gray alone!

Now this is rich!
Our juvenile little princess thinks her soul is worth something.

...!

Do you believe you can just make a contract with them like it's nothing?
How unbelievably gullible you'd have to be!

Very well.
Young lady.
Do you wish to offer your soul?

Now wait a minute!
This has to be a joke, right?
This asinine child doesn't even understand the meaning of devotion...!

That isn't something you'll be the judge of, surrogate.

...!

Are you certain of this, Your Honor?

DIS has approved her terms.
A contract can be formed.

Hoooo!
This got super interesting!

I'll ask you once more, young lady.
Do you wish to offer your soul in exchange for the safety of this woman?
... Yeah.
I do.

Your Highness, wait!
I can't accept this!
You there...!
You seem like the leader of this bunch...
I beg you, take my soul instead!
Tear my body apart if you have to!

... I'm afraid that's not possible.
But if you truly wish to reclaim her...
Meet us at the end of the Void.
She will be waiting for you there...
There DIS will revaluate the worthiness of your devotion.

What...
What's going on...
How did it come to this...?!

Gray.
...!

You worry too much.
It's better this way.
Earlier I was so scared I thought I'd rather die...
Now I don't even really know what's happening, or where I'm headed to, either...
But for as long as you stand there...
I'm not afraid.
Like how you always kept believing in me...
I'll now place my faith in you.
And...

...
Lily...
Please take care of it while I'm away.
It's an important wedding gift and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it.
So make sure to return it, alright?

Your Honor, our time is almost up.

...
Are you ready, young lady?

You can bet your ass on it, tinhead!
It's about time I start to live up to that nickname of mine...!
Very well.

There's something I need to tell you.
<disappears>

... Who would've guessed.
Well, this result is as good as any.
Unfortunately I'm not willing to take the risk of leaving you alive.
This time I won't miss!
Nothing's happening...?!

Ooh, forgot to mention.
Since you didn't finish the sacrifice in time, your contract has been voided.
So you can say goodbye to those magical finger snapping powers of yours and what not.

This isn't funny, Bee...!
I was only one short!
Do I look like I care?
Besides I've got a feeling that's the least of your problems right now...
See ya soon!

Gray, please...
This has been a rough day for us all...

Tried fixing it.
After fixing:
#+begin_quote
It was years ago but I still remember it vividly.
At the time I was hardly having any sleep.
So I got out of bed early to catch a glimpse of a solar eclipse.
When it was over, I saw a strange woman covered in tattered clothes in the middle of the street.
She was just lying there, quietly, gently holding something between her hands.
Almost as if she'd appeared out of nowhere.

... That woman was Gray?

Yeah.

#+begin_quote
After the dust was settled, we took you to a checkup.
You'd already grown into a perfectly healthy baby.
Gray, however...
It was hard to tell at a glance, but her body was covered in old bruises and scars.
The doctor also noticed something abnormal.
Her womb and ovaries were both missing, as if they'd been completely removed.
Yet there were no signs of surgery of any kind, despite all the other damage her internal organs had sustained.
She couldn't have ever given birth, that much was certain.

...
I guess that settles it then.

You hardly sound surprised.

I had my doubts.
For longer than I care to admit.
#+end_quote

No stairs this time, another scrambled image.

#+begin_quote
What about my real parents?
Didn't Gray tell you about them?

Not much.
When I asked about your father, she told me he died a long time ago.
And your mother..
Gray never said anything about her.
But whenever I tried to bring it up...
Gray wouldn't admit it, but I could see it opened some wounds much deeper than those on her skin.

... Am I supposed to feel sorry for her now?

Lillie...
I can't pretend to understand what you're going through.
But I do know that Gray always took care of you like one of her own.
She loved you more than anything.

Loved?

What a time and place for you to show up.
What took you so long?
Did you start to miss me while I was gone?

...

Guess the cat got your tongue.
Again.
You aren't still mad about the hair, are you?
After cutting it, I tried dyeing it at one point as well.
Too bad the colour didn't stick properly.
I would've loved to see your reaction.

...

Here we go again with that judgemental leer.
I'm starting to recall why I left in the first place.

<Gray embraces her>

I'm still mad at you.

I just wish you were here to hear that.

"For these defects, and for no other evil, we now are lost and punished just with this."
"We have no hope and yet we live in longing."
<Void court appears, Bee is missing>
... It seems we're one short.
What happened to them?
Beats me.
...
What an interesting development.
Stranger.
Making it this far should be commendable...
But DIS cannot detect a strong devotion within you.
Under normal circumstances, an aimless soul would slowly fade away at the depths of this compound.
Yet here you stand before us.
This situation is quite unorthodox...
Nevertheless we can't have you remain here.
As long as you leave in peace...
DIS is willing to make a contract with you.
So tell us.
What is it that you desire?

Desire?
I'm not sure if I've ever given it a proper thought.

Surely there is something your soul craves.
Power?
Wealth?
Love?
Or maybe...
Something you've lost.
Something very important.

... ... ...
Could you really fulfill something like that?
Who...
Or what are you, exactly?
Demons?
Gods?

Answers to such questions would be meaningless to you, stranger.
But I'll say this much.
No desire, no matter how great, is beyond the realm of possibilities.

...!

Is there a problem?

I'm alright now.
I was just feeling a bit lightheaded for a moment.
...
If I could wish for one thing...
I want my mother to know that no matter the reason she chose me...
I'm grateful for everything.
Please, let her have her peace.

So?

...
To be perfectly honest, Your Highness.
I find it too sophisticated for my taste.

I just hope one day she'll shine just as bright.
Until then...

Oooh, what're these?

(Don't just ignore me like that you lazy ass...)

These're called photos, right?
How cute!
Did Gray take these?

Yeah, there's a whole album of them.
She was never too keen on technology...
But she did enjoy using a camera quite a lot.
Maybe she hoped to share these pictures with you one day...
Speaking of...

What is it?
I was supposed to give you this a while ago.

A letter, for me?
But why has it already been opened?

Here's the funny thing...
I actually found it in my room and thought it was addressed to me.
So I opened it and...
I couldn't understand a single word.
Gray must've written in one of those ancient languages she used to study.
But now that you're here...
I figured she left it for you.

...
Not quite.
This is meant for both of us.

...
Get out!
What does it say?!

Let's see...

<Cut to the void, white-haired girl speaking to glasses demon>

But I know you've been watching over them for a long time now.
Or did that child end up here by sheer accident, only to finally meet their mother?

...
That's what Add would've wanted.
I owed it to them.
Besides, I only gave them a small push.

Sure.
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

Hmph.
I've kept my end of the bargain.
Now, stranger...
Have you finished your research?

More or less.

So I take it you'll be leaving soon.
Then answer me.
Who or what is DIS?

... ... ...
I surmise this place was originally some sort of a research facility governed by an entity known as DIS.
Unfortunately even I'm not able to access the true depths of this compound, so the details remain hazy.
The main server's been locked behind mechanically surveilled areas.
If I had to guess, I'd say not a single living soul has entered them in a few millennia.
And most likely never will again.

...
<Error windows appear>
However, there were a few remote memory units I was able to access.
Most of them were dilapidated beyond repair.
But even just a fraction of their data tells quite a telling tale.
Scattered resarch notes regarding quantum space travel, warp technology, gene splicing...
Even more curious is the fact that all these records end abruptly at the same point in time.
That was over 70000 years ago.
Some kind of cataclysmic event must've taken place here a long time ago.
Did an experiment backfire?
Or maybe a war broke loose?
Whatever the case, it seems that the manusya of this planet were nearly wiped out.
<Windows close>

... So why are we still here?
What's our purpose?

I'm afraid I don't have an answer to that either.
Maybe DIS is still attempting to fulfill the original role of this facility.
Whatever that might be.

...
That's just a fancy way of implying we're mere guinea pigs to it, correct?

... I'm sorry.
It must've been hard for you and your sisters, all these years...

Don't get me wrong.
The time we deserved some sympathy is long gone.
Considering all the things we've been part of...
I only wished for some closure.
Before you go...
Can I ask you something else?
Why were you so interested in the princess?

... ... ...
Hmm...
This'll probably sound pretty silly to you, but...
She reminded me of someone, that's all.
Guess we're in the same boat.
<Door appears>
I'll be leaving now.
I hope that one day you find the answers you're looking for.
Until then...
Take care, Cif.

You've traveled far, stranger.
Through these endless halls, you've shown us the extent of your devotion.
We applaud you.

Congratulations.

Congratulations!

Stranger.
Your devotion has exceeded the expectations of DIS.
For such a display alone, DIS is willing to make a contract with you.
So tell us.
What is it that you desire?

... Give her back.
Please, give Lily back to me.

...
Your devotion continues to impress.
Thus, you're allowed to take one soul with you.
With one condition.
You may never return here.
Do you accept these terms?

I do.

Very well.

... Wha are you waiting for?
I'm done with playing your games!

An incongruity has risen with this particular subject.
A zygote inside the subject has developed into a blastocyst and attached itself into the mucous membrane of the womb.

Tsygowhat now?

... In layman's terms, another soul has begun to grow inside the princess.

No...
No no no no no no!
You're lying!

Stranger.

Don't you dare say it...!

Which soul do you wish to take with you?

Shut up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
You think I'm goin to just accept this?!
You tricked me!
This DIS you keep mentioning...
Let me talk directly to them!
I want to know what this is all about!
Why do you keep toying with us like this...
... You treacherous fiends!

...
Even if you were to find our actions heartless or incomprehensible...
That's not something you should concern yourself with, stranger.
No matter how things may have turned out...
This choice was made for you.
That's the only thing that matters now.

...
... I want to see her.

... Very well.

She is...
Asleep?

More or less.
Our life support systems are keeping her in a state one could liken to an artificial coma.
Fret not, her rest is a peaceful one.

Does she know...?

Highly unlikely.
If you were to take her with you...
All of this would be but a dream to her.
I'll ask you once more, stranger.
What's your decision?

Guess that settles it then.
